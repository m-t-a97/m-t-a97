## Hi there :wave:, my name's Tanvir.

<p>I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer who uses the latest and greatest technologies. I'm always striving to better myself and learn new skills, as well as bolster my skillset in the process. What motivates me to keep learning new tech is that somewhere down the line, it will benefit me whenever I am in a situation where that tech/skill would be required. This is why I never give up on trying to learn new things every day.

- :computer: I’m currently working on building apps on both Web2 and Web3 primarily using React, NodeJS and Ethereum as well.
- :seedling: I’m currently learning more about Web3 and Blockchain by creating dapps and developing smart contracts using Solidity.
- :trophy: I’m looking to collaborate on Web3 projects right now either in open-source or in hackathons / bounties, so reach out to me if you need any teammates :thumbsup:
