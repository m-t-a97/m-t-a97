## Hi there :wave:, my name's Tanvir.

<p>I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer who uses the latest and greatest technologies. I'm always striving to better myself and learn new skills, as well as bolster my skillset in the process. What motivates me to keep learning new tech is that somewhere down the line, it will benefit me whenever I am in a situation where that tech/skill would be required. This is why I never give up on trying to learn new things every day.
